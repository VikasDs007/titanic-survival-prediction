# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It is a classic machine learning use case and serves as an excellent starting point for beginners.

## Steps Involved

1. **Introduction to Titanic Survival Prediction**:
   - Discuss the prediction of Titanic survival using machine learning.
   - This project is a common introductory use case for machine learning.
   - Data analysis and visualization are key components of the project.

2. **Data Preparation and Analysis**:
   - Load data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis, including plotting graphs to understand patterns (e.g., priority given to women and children).

3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Address missing values by either dropping columns or filling them with appropriate statistics.
   - For instance, fill the age column with the median value, while the embarked column is filled with the mode.

4. **Data Encoding and Splitting**:
   - Encode categorical data into numerical values (e.g., gender and embarkation points).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Use a logistic regression model for prediction.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy scores.
   - Discuss the importance of avoiding overfitting.
   - The final model achieved an accuracy of around 81% on the training data.
